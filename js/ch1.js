// Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.
var i=0;
var limit=10;
for(i;i<=limit;i++){
    if(i%2==0){
        console.log(i)
    }
}
